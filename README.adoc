// NOTES: 100L constructor should be tested with a stock getter.
//        the 2-5L requirement is not tested, should be in there
//        the barkeeper.serve() test is incomplete

*In the pub*

toc::[]

*Goal*: Your task is to implement and test the process of drinking beer in a pub. Write unit tests to test:
. If your implementation works and 
. If it conforms to the specification
. if exceptions are properly handled. 

*Work test driven!*

== Background info

This exercise focus on  

_Here are the specifications of this exercise. Turn them into *testable requirements* before you start your TDD process._

. Initially the pub has 100L of beer available (check the MainSimulation class).
. A barkeeper and beer drinkers belong to a Pub.
. Beer drinkers can ask the barkeeper for beer.
. Beer is handed out either in small format (0.2L) or pint format (0.57L).
. Beer drinkers can only drink a limited amount of beer, between 2L and 5L.

== TODO

The BarkeeperTest class has the needed variables and the "beforeEach" method. use them in your tests.

. Implement the barkeeper test!
. Implement the getMessageOrDefault();

In your first test method, you want to test whether the tapping of beer works as intended. Let the test fail first,
then implement the logic of that test. When you have finished,continue to the next part.

The exercise is finished when you have tested and implemented each requirement.
